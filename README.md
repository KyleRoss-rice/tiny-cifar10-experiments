# tiny-cifar10-experiments
Our project attempts to explore different methods in performing image classification using a small number of training samples.

In our experiments, we use only 100 class-balanced samples from CIFAR-10.

## File structure
Our workflow uses multiple _Google Colab_ files, as we use the platform for all data processing, training and evaluation, as well as creating our models. These files are found in the _scripts_ and _models_.

Our generated datasets are found in _datasets_.
