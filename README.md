# tiny-cifar10-experiments
Our project attempts to explore different methods in performing image classification using a small number of training samples.

In our experiments, we use only 100 class-balanced samples from CIFAR-10.

## File Structure
Our workflow uses multiple _Google Colab_ files, as we use the platform to write all our source code.
